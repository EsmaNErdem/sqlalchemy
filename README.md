# sqlalchemy
In this exercise, I was able to practice how to create databases and connect them to Flask app by using SQLAlchemy.  I use object-oriented techniques to create tables and instances in db. With this exercise, I was able to practice Flask and made feel good that FLask is becoming natural to code with.
